# Curriculum Vitae

Luke Carbis is a self-deputised open-source emissary and vigilante plenipotentiary for WordPress proletariat affairs. And although he enjoys a little facetious satire, he takes seriously the work he does with WordPress based startups to fast-track their growth and inspire beautifully design products.

## Open Source

I have been an active contributor to the WordPress project since 2015. Although many of my contributions are code based, I have also organised meetups, organised multiple "WordCamp" multi-day conferences, and served as a core member of Release Teams (including Release Lead for version 4.9.1).

## Employment History

#### Visser Labs

2012—2014 / _Cofounder and Lead Developer_

I started this business in 2012 building ecommerce plugins for WordPress. We knew ecommerce would be a growth industry, so decided to build tools for the miners. We maintained a small team with a focus on building a long-term, sustainable, lifestyle business. I exited the company in 2014, but it [continues to sell ecommerce solutions](https://visser.com.au) to this day.

#### WP Stream

2014—2015 / _Lead Developer, Head of Product_

Stream was a whirlwind ride! I was employee number 3, leading the V1 development and architecture of our WordPress plugin. Our go-to-market was extremely successful – so much so that our investor pushed us to release a SaaS based V2. After building a team of around 6 engineers, the SaaS launch was somewhat of a failure. With our infrastructure costs far outweighing our SaaS revenue, we searched for a buyer who could help sustain the product in the long term. We found that in XWP.

#### XWP

2015—2019 / _Head of Product and Innovation_

At XWP my first task was to transition Stream to a more sustainable model. I achieved this with a V3 launch inside 6 months, which was extremely well received. This lead to a Head of Product position within the company. In the context of an enterprise agency, Head of Product meant both leading the development of our own internal products, as well as consulting, architecting, and ultimately building the products of our enterprise customers.

The products I worked on included the News Corp web platform (which powers all their sites, including news.com.au), GoDaddy's email marketing platform, and BigCommerce's WordPress integration. But these products pale in comparison to the people I worked with – the brightest, most talented, and most ego-free web developers, QA specialists, project managers, and product designers on the planet.

I eventually had a falling out with the owner of XWP. After some early interactions and small projects with Google, I was unwilling to continue working on their AMP framework, as I believed the project directly violated XWP's (and my own) core purpose: "[Build a better web](https://xwp.co)". I accepted a small severance to work on a product of my own.

#### Block Lab

2019—2020 / _Cofounder and Head of Product_

Recognising the impact of WordPress' transition from PHP templates to React block-based editing, I built a product which enabled agencies to create modern WordPress sites using traditional / existing workflows. It was the first product of its type, and it was tremendously well received. Within 3 months of starting work, we pre-launched Block Lab and began building customers and revenue. In a little over six months, the product was fully launched and we were making considerable figures. Noticing our success, WP Engine approached us with a very attractive offer of acquisition.

During this year I also held several small consulting contracts involving two key areas of interest: implementing agile workflows, and web security.

#### WP Engine

2020—2021 / _Who knows?_

Unfortunately, as is often the case, our fast-moving startup team of passionate founders were quickly mired in bureaucracy and politics. I did my one-year golden-handcuffs gig and left.


### Carbis Web Development

2021—2022

I went freelance. I've got some _amazing_ clients who I adore working with, and all of whom are startups looking to build a better web.
